# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description 

This repository is where the Horiseon Marketing Agency's website's code is refactored. The Horiseon Marketing Agency's website needs its HTML and CSS code to be refactored in order to follow accessibility standards and to better optimize the website for search engines. Additionally, there are broken links and extraneous CSS rules within the code that Horiseon wishes to consolidate.

As of commit d30df32 of master branch, code has been refactored by changing `<title>` to be more specific/descriptive, changing `<div>` elements to semantically appropriate alternatives, fixing broken links, fixing skipped headings, adding comments to code, and consolidating CSS rules.
